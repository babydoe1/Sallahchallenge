    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerger the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <i><b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b></i> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
